# Turnover-Impact
Turnovers are one of the most impactful events in basketball and can quickly swing the outcome of a game, but tracking of the context around turnovers is limited. This project incorporates the context around turnovers to evaluate just how impactful a turnover is on the outcome of a basketball game. To evaluate game impact, we use machine learning techniques on the data around each turnover, including variables such as shot clock remaining, live vs dead ball turnovers, and results of the next possession. This impact determination is then applied to players/teams to measure the aggregated effect of their turnovers.
